# Main design

Dark emerald - oppensource mmo-rpg that offers a “mega grind” experience based on a huge number of characteristics, items and synergies between everything.

## Lore

The game is set in Dashworld, a medieval fantasy world, midway between dark fantasy and romantic (there's a lot of good in the world, but that's not to say it's all good).
But each build can create its own story...

## Gameplay

2D.
Players need to collect various items, weapons, combine them to get different builds.
